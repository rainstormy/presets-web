# This workflow implements the continuous integration (CI) pipeline.
# It validates the software quality and produces build artifacts that can be deployed at a later stage.
#
# It is triggered automatically by pull requests opened towards the `main` branch.
#
# It can be triggered manually on any branch via the GitHub CLI:
#
#   gh workflow run ci.yml [--ref <branch-name>]
#   gh run watch
#
# It can be triggered manually on any branch via the GitHub web interface:
#   https://github.com/rainstormy/presets-web/actions/workflows/ci.yml
